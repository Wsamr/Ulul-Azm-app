# Ulul Azm -App

A Flutter application that brings together Islamic content including the full Quran, khutbahs (sermons), and books. The app fetches content using APIs and allows users to view documents such as khutbahs and books in PDF format directly within the app. State management is handled using Cubit for a clean and reactive architecture.
